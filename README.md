# Instructions

## Introduce yourself

Fork this repo then edit the [Introduction](introduction.md) to write one for yourself. By all means change or add sections. Then publish a link to your introduction in the Springboard community Introductions forum. After this, we'll all feel like we know each other and you'll be experienced with GitHub!

NB You could also edit this README file to describe the contents of this repository and its purpose.

## Additional material

Need some additional help or explanation on a section of the course? Have a look my [DS1 supplemental](DS1_supplement.md). It provides help with installing and setting up R, additional explanations of some methods, and some problems for self-assessment.

Looking for some more reading material? Add these [data science books and resources](reading_DS1.md) to your reading list.

Most students are looking for a career change. Springboard provides some great resources; [here are those and more](Data_Science_Job_Search_Resources.md)
