# Biography

Hi everyone. My name is Tom. I have a background in innovation and research and development. It was my early days as a materials science researcher that got me into data science&mdash;before the blend of software engineering, science, hacking, statistics, and domain knowledge had a name.

# What I hope to gain from this course

Three things I hope to gain from this course are:

1. Helping others to learn new skills
2. Encouraging [evidence-based decision making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_management)

# What challenges I anticipate facing

I am very busy and time is very precious. It is going to be very
hard finding the time to balance my commitments at home and at work while studying 10 &ndash; 15 hours each week.

# What strategies I will use to overcome these challenges

I will establish a set routine for every-day activities, like dinner, studying, and sleeping. This will include a core of 10 hours in the working week, which can be supplemented on the weekend. I will not watch TV or go out during the week.

# My capstone project ideas

Some questions on my mind at the moment include:

* Can historic house prices reveal gentrification waves?
* Is gentrification associated with increased homelessness?
* When is the best time to donate to homeless causes?

My thinking here is that historic house price data is readily available, but
a key question is how to define, and thus detect, gentrification. How would I best
divide the spatial data into regions? Assuming gentrification can be defined/detected,
can I obtain matching (regional) data on homelessness? I believe this is notoriously
underreported. This may be a problem for that question. For the final question, I will
look at homeless charities and see if they publish any data. My starting assumption is
that Christmas is a popular time for goodwill, with Christmas dinners provided in various
locations and shelters opening their doors. But what about the cold months after? Does the
surge of goodwill and public attention drop, leaving the homeless literally out in the cold?
Will I need some sort of supply and demand data from a charity?
