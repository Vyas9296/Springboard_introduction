## Unit 6: Data Story

### The importance of the data story

When the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds into launch on January 28, 1986, the engineers who designed the solid rocked boosters at Morton Thiokol knew what had happened. They had predicted it.

They also failed to effectively tell the data story to NASA decision-makers. Their data story failed them, with disastrous results. Edward Tufte has looked at this part of the failure, and you can see some of the slides prepared for the after-accident investigation, and one much clearer redesign by Tufte in [this blog post by Bruce Tognazzini](http://www.asktog.com/books/challengerExerpt.html).

As Tufte concludes in his analysis, "_there are right ways and wrong ways to show data; there are displays that reveal the truth and displays that do not_."[^1]

The data story is, in many ways, much more important than the data analysis itself.

### Writing the report

You have two main deliverables in the capstone project: a written report and a slide deck (e.g. PowerPoint). Writing technical reports is an art in itself, and there is no better guidance in how to write them than [Katzoff's 1964 "Clarity in Technical Reporting"](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/media-arts-and-sciences/mas-111-introduction-to-doing-research-in-media-arts-and-sciences-spring-2011/readings/MITMAS_111S11_read_ses5.pdf). I _strongly_ recommend reading this 25 page booklet in preparation for writing your project report.

If you find yourself wanting more after reading Katzoff, the science magazine *Nature* also provides an ebook, [_Communication for Scientists_](https://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/english-communication-for-scientists-14053993/contents), that goes into somewhat more detail than Katzoff's work. NASA's Lewis Research Center likewise offers a more details-oriented tract, Vidoli's ["Technical Report Writing"](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930013813.pdf).

### Examples

It's much easier to learn what good data stories looks like, compared to "wrong" data stories, with paired examples. Unfortunately, most people don't publish bad versions of their analyses, so these are hard to find. In addition to the example above, Edward Tufte's (inactive) discussion forum contains examples, including a good thread on [cancer survival rates](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Jr&topic_id=1&topic=Ask+E%2eT%2e), where Tufte and his readers iterate through the same data multiple times.

Garr Reynolds, of [Presentation Zen](http://www.presentationzen.com), also tries to fill this gap with his books and blog posts on presentation design. Some of the more starkly-contrasted examples are drawn from comparing presentations by Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. The differences in [visual complexity](http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2005/11/the_zen_estheti.html) and [message clarity](http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/09/steve-bill-redu.html) are clear. Reynolds even compares [Bill Gates to Bill Gates](http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2010/08/the-naked-transformation-of-bill-gates-the-presenter.html).
