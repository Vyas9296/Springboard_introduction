# DS1 Course Supplemental Resources

To help with common questions, I've prepared supplemental material for some of the units.

**[Unit 1](DS1_supplement_U1.md)**: A nice overview of the methods of data science; public data sources suitable for a capstone project.

**[Unit 2](DS1_supplement_U2.md)**: Types of data; the assignment operators in R; subsetting data frames and extracting data from them; installing R and RStudio; setting up Git, GitHub and connecting RStudio to GitHub.

*There are also additional practice problems that I ask students attempt at the end of Unit 2.*

**Unit 3**: Data Wrangling

Estimates show that "80% of a data scientist's time is spent wrangling data." ([2015, CrowdFlower](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2902920/the-data-science-ecosystem-part-2-data-wrangling.html)).

**[Unit 6](DS1_supplement_U6.md)**: More on the data story, how to write a technical report, and further resources for presentations.

**[Unit 7](DS1_supplement_U7.md)**: The missing lesson: intro time series.
