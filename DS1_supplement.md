# DS1 Course Supplemental Resources

To help with common questions, I've prepared supplemental material for some of the units.

[Unit 1](DS1_supplement_U1.md): A nice overview of the methods of data science; public data sources suitable for a capstone project.

[Unit 2](DS1_supplement_U2.md): More on assignment operators; subsetting data frames and extracting data from them; installing R and RStudio; setting up Git, GitHub and connecting RStudio to GitHub.

There are also additional practice problems that I ask students attempt at the end of Unit 2.

[Unit 6](DS1_supplement_U6.md): More on the data story, how to write a technical report, and how to present.

[Unit 7](DS1_supplement_U7.md): The missing lesson: intro time series.
