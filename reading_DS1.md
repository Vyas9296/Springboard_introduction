# Annotated Reading List for Springboard Foundations of Data Science

## Statistics and Machine Learning

* If you’d like a reference on your shelf that covers Units 1 – 3 of the DS1 course, Hadley Wickham’s _R for Data Science_ is a great resource, and a version is [available online](http://r4ds.had.co.nz).
* A good reference on basic statistics (covering unit 3 and part of unit 7, plus some additional material) is Dalgaard's _Introductory Statistics with R_. This is basically a quick reference, and not an in-depth textbook. All examples are in R, so rather than being an esoteric statistics quick reference, it's very practical for the R user.
* _Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R_, by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani, is a good introduction that also gets into deep learning (support vector machines and unsupervised learning). The seventh edition is [available as a PDF free online](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).
* _Machine Learning in R_, by Lantz, is a great, easy introduction to many of the same topics in the DS1 course, with a few new methods thrown in.
* _Machine Learning for Hackers_, by Conway and White has about 50% overlap with Lantz’s book, but the additions are worth reading, and Conway/White’s take on the overlap provides some nice insights.
* Hastie and Tibshirani have another book, _Elements of Statistical Learning_, that I’ve often seen recommended. It spends more time on model selection and assessment, and also gets into more advanced methods (e.g. ensemble learning). An earlier edition of this is also available as a PDF for free online.
* _Deep Learning_ by Goodfellow, et al., is widely recommended for advanced deep learning methods…I’ve not read it, but suspect, from reviews, that it’s very much an introductory text.
* _Statistics in a Nutshell_, by Boslaugh, is a nice desk reference to have on-hand.

## Business and Industrial Processes
If you’ll be involved with understanding, designing, or optimizing business processes, Donald Wheeler’s small _Understanding Variation: The key to managing chaos_ is indispensable.

If you’ll be involved in any industrial data science (e.g. manufactured product or manufacturing process design or improvement), Wheeler's _The Six Sigma Practitioner’s Guide to Data Analysis_ and _EMP III : Using Imperfect Data_, as well as Box, Hunter and Hunter’s _Statistics for Experiments_ should be on your bookshelf.

## Reports and Presentation

All of your efforts at analysis will be wasted if you cannot communicate the meaning effectively to non-technical audiences.

For preparing visuals&mdash;displaying quantitative information&mdash;Tufte and Cleveland works should be on every data scientist's bookshelf.

* Tufte’s _The Visual Display of Quantitative Information_, 
* Cleveland’s _The Elements of Graphing Data_, 
* Wickham’s _ggplot2_ book. 

For great advice on presentations, pick up
 
* Garr's _Presentation Zen_ and 
* Duarte's _Resonate_.

## Advanced R

If you plan on using R in a production environment (i.e. using R to generate the same analyses and/or reports automatically or on a regular basis), then Wickham’s _[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz)_ and _[R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz)_, as well as _[Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/)_.
